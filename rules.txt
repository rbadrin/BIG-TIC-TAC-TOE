Each small 3-by-3 tic-tac-toe board is referred to as a local board, and the 
   larger 3-by-3 board is referred to as the global board. The game starts with 
X  playing wherever he wants in any of the 81 empty spots. This move 'sends' 
 his  opponent to its relative location. For example, if X played in the middle
 of his local board, then O needs to play next in the local board in the middle 
 of the global board. If a move is played so that it is to win a local board 
by the rules of normal tic-tac-toe, then it wins that local board. Once the
 outcome of a local board is decided (win or draw), if a player is sent to
 such a board, then that player may play in any other board. Game play ends when
 either a player wins the global board, or there are no legal moves remaining.
